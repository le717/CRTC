* Fork the **CRTC** repository by clicking ![the Fork button.](http://i81.servimg.com/u/f81/16/33/06/11/forkme12.png)
* Download and install the [Microsoft Ajax Minifier](http://ajaxmin.codeplex.com/) for minifiying the CSS and JavaScript.
* Clone **CRTC** onto your computer by running ```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CRTC.git``` and switch to the `gh-pages` branch if necessary.
* Start editing away! Fix bugs, improve the JavaScript, update styling, whatever! Do not, however, that jQuery has intentionally not been used in this project. Ideally, your changes will continue this trend, but if you feel like converting everything to jQuery or your changes absolutely require jQuery, I most likely will not object. :wink:
