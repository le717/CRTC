# [CRTC - Website](http://le717.github.io/CRTC) #

This is the readme to **CRTC**, a website experiment written by
[Triangle717](http://Triangle717.WordPress.com) and [rioforce](http://rioforce.WordPress.com)
to calculate approximate GPU render times when using the [Blender Cycles Engine](http://www.blender.org).

## Why Was This Created ##

It is said that "Necessity is the mother of invention". That can be said of this small tool.
Rioforce and I were always spending lots of time trying to figure out when his render would be completed,
and we were tired of it. We finally determined I should write a Python program to do this for us.
Thus **CRTC** was born.

On October 18, 2013, I began rewriting **CRTC** in HTML5/JavaScript form
as an experiment and learning project on how to create websites. It is hosted using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

## Releases ##

All website revisions are available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/le717/CRTC/releases).
